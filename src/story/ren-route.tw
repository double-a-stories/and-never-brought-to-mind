:: Go to the garage. [todo]
You walk down the hall and enter the garage. Parked inside is a clean and polished pickup truck from a luxury brand, and a similarly ostentatious boat.

A few feet ahead of you, you see a red fox, who appears to be struggling to carry a huge cardboard box. Stacked haphazardly on top is a number of objects, including some electronics, a game console, two silver candelabras, and what appears to be a priceless oil painting. The fox notices you.

"Hiya! 😊👋🐾" they say, talking in an... unusually expressive manner.

\> [[Ask him what he's up to.]] *(Male Pred)*

\> [[What's she doing?]] *(Female Pred)*


:: Ask him what he's up to.
<% s.rm = true; %>

<%= story.render("...What are you doing?") %>

<div->[[...What are you doing?]]</div>

:: What's she doing?
<% s.rm = false; %>

<%= story.render("...What are you doing?")%>

<div->[[...What are you doing?]]</div>


:: ...What are you doing?
You ask <%=s.rm?"him":"her"%> what <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%>'s doing.

<%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> smiles and replies, "Stealing! 🦊<%=s.rm?"🦹‍♂️":"🦹‍♀️"%>💰"

Huh, yeah, you guess that was pretty obvious.

"Your timing is 👌 perf," <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> says, gesturing with <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> bushy tail towards the truck, "Could you unlatch the 🛻 tailgate for me?"

\> [[Is that a good idea?]]


:: Is that a good idea?
"🤨  Um, it's a *great* idea? I've always wanted some of this 🎮🖼️💰 stuff!"

You say you meant, like, ethically. Won't the folks who live here be upset about this?

"The 🐴 folks who live here are loaded. They probs won't even notice! 🙈<%=s.rm?"🤷‍♂️":"🤷‍♀️"%>"

And what if they do? you ask.

"Sounds like a problem for <%=s.rm?"🦹‍♂️":"🦹‍♀️"%> Future Ren," <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> chuckles, "I'm Ren, btw. 😉"

\> [[Uh, I'm Hollis.]]


:: Uh, I'm Hollis.

You're Hollis, you reply, scratching your ears nervously.

"Pleased to meet you 🐰😎 dude!" <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> says. "Can I call you dude? Or are you more of a... 🐰👩❓ dudestress?"

A-actually, you're neither? you reply.

"Oh, neat! 🐰👤" <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> smiles, carefully balancing the almost cartoonishly large pile of stolen goods, "Anyway, I could use some help with that latch. Any time now! ⏳"

\> [[Help with the latch.|Help Ren.]]

\> [[Don't.|Don't help Ren.]]


:: Don't help Ren.

You don't assist <%=s.rm?"him":"her"%>, instead choosing to carefully back toward the door, so as not to seem complicit in <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> burglary. If anyone asks, you were just looking to get some fresh air, when you stumbled upon this eccentric kitsune stealing a load of valuables. It's the perfect alibi, you think, because it's completely true.

Ren struggles to keep the box steady. "🛻 Trunk... Now... Please? ⏳⏳⏳ I'm in kind of a pickle here, and if you don't, I'm... gonna... Ack! 😨😨😨"

\> [[Go back to the foyer...?|Ren drops the boxes.]]

:: Ren drops the boxes.
<%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> loses <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%>  balance and drops the box, sending all of its contents crashing to the ground, including a fine porcelain teapot and a GameStation 4 Pro. <%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> watches helplessly as they smash into several pieces.

 "😦😟😔" <%=s.rm?"His":"Her"%>  ears and whiskers droop with defeat. <%=s.rm?"He":"She"%>  looks like <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%>'s about to cry.

Taking this as your cue to leave, you twist the knob to the garage door. Just as you do, Ren growls, "👿👿👿 *Don't move.* I'm not done with you. 💢"

\> [[Hollis: Escape.]]


:: Help Ren.
*CW: Crimes? Crimes.*

You can't fault <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> logic. Well, you can, but you probably shouldn't get on this fox's bad side. You walk over and unlatch the tailgate so Ren can load <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> pile of loot onto the flatbed.

"😌💦 Phew," <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> says, closing it up again, "I owe ya one! 🫂🫂"

Ren suddenly grabs you into a warm hug, affectionately wrapping <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> tail around your whole body for a moment, before releasing you as if nothing happened.

N-no problem, you stammer!

<%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> walks around to the driver-side door, <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> tail already wagging with the excitement of a successful heist.

\> [[Is this your truck?]]


:: Is this your truck?
You ask Ren if this is <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> vehicle, even though you probably know the answer already.

Ren hops into the driver's seat, sniffs around a bit, and jingles a set of keys that was stashed in a cup-holder. "🔑😁 It is now!" <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%>  laughs,  "Wanna take it for a little spin? 🛻😃"

\> [[Hey, why not?]]

\> [[That seems like a bad idea...]]


:: Hey, why not?
You seriously consider <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> offer. You had reservations at first, but the more you think about it, the more excited you are to partake in a high-stakes getaway as this strange fox's unwitting accomplice. It almost feels like you're in some kind of video game.

You don't want to be the only one here when someone notices everything that's missing, but it really feels like you're forgetting something.

\> [[I can't leave my friend...]]


:: I can't leave my friend...
You remember that Reese is still here, and possibly in danger. You can't just abandon him, not at a party full of predators!

"Oh, your 🐹 friend's totally in some pred's belly by now, 🐺🤰" Ren says.

What? You ask <%=s.rm?"him":"her"%> how <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> knows.

"<%=s.rm?"🤷‍♂️":"🤷‍♀️"%> Call it a hunch," <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> says, "No prey ever came to a party like this expecting to leave in one piece, right? Everyone's either here to 🐺 eat or be 🥩 eaten."

You didn't realize this was that kind of party, you say.

Ren smirks, "Want a ride home?"

\> [[No, I really shouldn't...]]


:: That seems like a bad idea...
Ren looks at you, surprised. "What, you're backing out now? I thought you were a 🐇 rabbit, not 🐔 chicken."

You say you'd really love to... commit grand theft auto, but as a rule, you try not to take rides from strangers.

"C'mon," the fox says with a vicious smile, "it'll be fun! A little joy-ride never hurt nobody!"

\> [[I can't leave my friend...]]


:: No, I really shouldn't...
Ren narrows <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> eyes. "You're just trying to snitch on me, aren't you. 😠"

What? No, you say. You're many things, but not a narc.

<%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> climbs out of the truck and advances towards you. "😠😠 Don't lie. I can *smell* your lies, 🦊🦊🦊" Ren says, nose twitching wildly, "You're practically *dripping* with deceit."

You nervously back away, praying that you'll be fast enough to make it out of here alive. With a deep breath, you book it toward the door back inside.

\> [[Hollis: Escape.]]


:: Hollis: Escape.
*CW: Violent threat. Unwilling vore. Bad breath.*

You're not fast enough. With the swiftness of a ninja, Ren leaps at you and grabs you by the middle. <%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> bares <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> teeth.

"😡 This is your fault," <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> seethes, "You were about to go tell on me, weren't you?"

\> [[What? No!]]

:: What? No!

No! You cry out, trying to wrestle free, you're not gonna tell anyone! Promise!

"🤬 Horsecrap!" <%=s.rm?"he":"she"%> says, bringing <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> sharp teeth right up against the exposed fur of your neck. This is a obscene gesture, uncommon among civilized anthros. <%=s.rm?"He":"She"%> growls, "Gimme one good reason I shouldn't eat you right now. 🥩🩸"

Your body is frozen. In the heat of the moment, flushed with fear, you try to reply. Your lips quiver, and your ears flatten, but your tongue won't form words.

"Whoops," Ren says, licking saliva from <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> lips, "😈 Too slow."

\> [[Ren: No witnesses.]]


:: Ren: No witnesses. [vore]
Your vision goes dark. Your ears feel slobbery. All you can smell is fish... What happened?

Ren glomps <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> lips over your head, and begins working to squeeze it into <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> throat. You try to squirm free, but <%=s.rm?'he':'she'%>'s gripping your body too tightly.

You look up at your destination, and wince slightly. The fox's <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> pulsating throat keeps blasting you with hot, putrid air. <%=s.rm?'He':'She'%> seems to be hyperventilating as <%=s.rm?'he':'she'%> eats you.

\> [[Struggle for freedom!]]

\> [[Try persuasion?]]


:: Try persuasion? [vore]
Your mouth is muffled by the slick tongue covering your face, but you try to call out to Ren: It's not too late! <%=s.rm?'He':'She'%> doesn't have to do this!

The fox lets out a low growl. ("😈<%=s.rm?'‍🧛🏻':'️🧛🏻‍♀️'%>👅") You realize <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> teeth are now positioned directly around your throat, and <%=s.rm?'he':'she'%> could easily bite your head off if so inclined. You rationally decide to keep your mouth shut from now on. <%=s.rm?'He':'She'%> responds with a happy murr ("🤤") and swallows again, so your shoulders fill <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> cheeks.

Your face is moments from sliding into <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> gullet.

\> [[Please! Don't do this!]]

\> [[Take a deep breath.]]


:: Take a deep breath. [vore]
Just before your head slips into the fox's slimy throat. You take in a big lungful of putrid air and hold it. <%= story.render("Get swallowed by Ren.") %>

<div->[[Get swallowed by Ren.]]</div>


:: Please! Don't do this! [vore]
You open your mouth to squeal one last plea for mercy. Unfortunately, you do this just before the fox gulps your head into <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> throat, and wind up inhaling a mouthful of saliva. You cough and wheeze uncomfortably. <%= story.render("Get swallowed by Ren.") %>

<div->[[Get swallowed by Ren.]]</div>


:: Struggle for freedom! [vore]

You thrash your arms and legs, trying to free yourself. Instinctively, the fox sinks <%=s.rm?'his':'her'%> teeth into your neck, something <%=s.rm?'he':'she'%> immediately regrets.

Everything feels hot and blurry. You fall unconscious.

"😨😨🥩🩸"

### Game Over.

\> <a0 onclick="setup.undo()">Undo</a>

\> [[Restart|Start]]

:: Get swallowed by Ren. [vore]

Your head slides into the tight fleshy tube with a slick *grlk* noise.

("🤤💦💦💦")

Ren is pretty big for a fox, but not the biggest anthro you've seen here. You get the feeling <%=s.rm?'he':'she'%>'s somewhat struggling to devour you. Still, this doesn't prevent <%=s.rm?'him':'her'%> from swallowing both your head and shoulders in a single powerful "😝 *gulp*~".

\> [[Enter Ren's stomach.]]


:: Enter Ren's stomach. [vore]

You're head pokes into Ren's stomach. It's wet. It's hot. It's wet and hot. Your legs slide in behind you. Ren swallows them with a satisfied "👅 Murr...", and they slide down <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> throat like thick, furry noodles.

You've never been eaten before, but it's basically exactly how you imagined it. Your body is packed tight into a curled up position, in a dank, squelching sac meant only for food.

As you lie here, now completely encapsulated in this fox's body, you feel almost... at home? As if you are fulfilling a role in the grand scheme of things. As though being devoured was exactly what was expected from you from the beginning.

Ren burps ("😌💨"), and <%=s.rm?"his":"her"%> stomach walls clench tighter around you. Maybe you should stop waxing pseudo-zen nonsense, and think of a way out of here?
