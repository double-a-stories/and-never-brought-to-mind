<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> has <%-R.Ana?"light gray fur with dark stripes":"sandy-colored fur with brown spots"%>, and a thick long neck. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%>'s wearing acid-wash jeans and a black tank-top over <%-R.Ana?"his chubby middle":"her considerable chest"%>. It reads <% if (R.Ana) { %><span title="bastards bleed">"SHy BΛSTARd"</span>. <% } else { %><span title="bad bitch">"BΛD BITCh"</span>.<% } %>


The hyena sees you staring, and looks up from <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> phone. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> notices you, and says, "Oh. Sup."

* [[What are you doing out here alone?]]
* [[Have you seen my friend?]]

:: What are you doing out here alone?
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> folds <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> arms and and flips <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> mohawk non-chalantly. "Could ask you the same question."

* [[I'm not really one for parties...]]
* [[Just... getting some air?]]

:: Just... getting some air?
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> kicks <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> feet up on the bench, and says, "Well, there's a free bench over there."

* [[Sit by yourself.]]
* [[Have you seen my friend?]]

:: I'm not really one for parties...
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> lets out a little sigh. "Yeah, me either. It's like, I'm supposed to be enjoying myself here? Making friends and eating people? But all the noise, and the crowds, I get freaked out. I guess I'm just trying to get away from it all for a moment."

* [[Same here...]]
* [[Wait, eating people?]]

:: Wait, eating people?
"Meeting," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> corrects <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%>, "Making friends and *meeting* people. I don't eat people, despite what you may have heard." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> clears <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> throat awkwardly. "I'm <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, by the way. <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> Rose." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pats spot on the bench next to <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>. "...You can sit if you want."
* [[I'm Hollis.|Tell Ana your name.]]

:: Same here...
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> nods, looking wistfully off into the distance. The moonlight reflects in <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> <%-R.Ana?"silvery":"amber"%> eyes.

"I'm <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, by the way. <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> Rose." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pats spot on the bench next to <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>. "...You can sit if you want."

* [[My name's Hollis!|Tell Ana your name.]]

:: Tell Ana your name.
You sit down on the bench, and tell <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> your name.

"Hollis," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> repeats, smiling slightly. "Cute name."

You're flustered, and not sure how to respond.

* [[Charm.]]
* [[I... um... think you're... also... cute?|(oh god oh fuck)]]

:: Charm.
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> cocks an eyebrow at you. "...What did you say?"

You realize that instead of saying or doing something charming, you literally just said the word *charm* out loud.

Thinking quickly you tell <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>, uh, you meant, that <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> seems very charming! No, wait, you're *charmed* to meet <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>! That's it. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> name's <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, yours is Hollis. Charmed.

* [[(oh god oh fuck)]]

:: (oh god oh fuck)
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> snickers as you helplessly tumble over your words. For a moment, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> hesitates, delicately running <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> tongue between <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> lips and over <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> pointy white teeth.

"Okay, Hollis. I... think you're kinda cute too," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "for a herbivore at least..." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> smiles at you, and brushes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> hair out of <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> eyes. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> seems to be a little more comfortable around you now. "Kinda cold out here, huh?"

* [[Do you want a hug?]]
* [[Anyway, I'm looking for this friend of mine?|I came here with a friend...]]

:: Do you want a hug? [checkpoint]
"...Sure, whatever," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> replies, with a little smile, and stretches out <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> arms. You wrap your arms around <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%>'s girthy middle, and hug. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> arms delicately wrap around you to return the warm gesture.

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%>'s wearing a lot of deodorant. Beneath it, your well-attuned nose whiffs the faintest undertone of perspiration. Still, it's not unpleasant. You can't remember the last time you were hugged.

After a what feels like a wonderful eternity, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> lets go. "That was nice," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, slouching down a little.

Yeah, you say, and tentatively rest your head against <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> shoulder.

* [[A quiet moment.]]
* [[Kiss <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>.|Kiss her.]]

:: Kiss her.
You've seen enough romance movies to know where this is going.
You're sure of it–this is the moment where you lean in, and both share a sudden yet dramatic first kiss.

You turn toward <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> big furry face, and attempt to kiss <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> on the mouth. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> immediately leans away, letting out a small, surprised growl.

"Woah there, casanova, that's, uh..." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> frowns. "I'm not really comfortable with that right now?"

* [[S-sorry!|Sorry for trying to kiss you.]]
* [[Try to kiss <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> again.|Kiss her again.]]

:: Kiss her again.
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> is visibly uncomfortable, and showing <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> teeth.

You reflect upon the obvious subtext of <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> response, and decide instead to delicately run a paw through <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> dark brown mohawk.

"...No seriously don't-...!!!"

* [[Stroke hair.|ENDING: Can't Take a Hint]]

:: ENDING: Can't Take a Hint [vore]
"...!!!"

The second you touch <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> hair, the hyena immediately lets out an vicious bark, and reflexively glomps <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> mouth down over your head. You faint from surprise. <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> quickly swallows your unconscious body, making sure no one else was around to see.

"Dammit," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> mutters, patting the massive bulge in <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> engorged belly, "Why is meeting new people so HARD??"

### Game Over

<%= Achievements.unlock("ANA_CHOMP_GAME_OVER") %>

* <%= T.rewind() %>

:: A quiet moment.
For a little while, neither of you say anything. The two of you sit there in comfortable silence, watching the stars.

"So," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> giggles eventually, "some party, huh."

 Yeah, you say, the music's kinda loud.

"Woof, I know, right? "I can't believe they're playing friggin' dubstep. Like, last century called?" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> snorts as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> laughs.

"I don't even know why I came here, honestly. It's just a bunch of horny rich college kids," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "-No offense." <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> looks over at you. "Why'd you even come here in the first place?"

* [[I came here with a friend...]]
* [[I think I want you to eat me...|Ana, I want you to eat me.]]

:: Sorry for trying to kiss you.
"No," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, smiling again, "I get it." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> gives you another hug.

<%= story.render("A quiet moment.") /* [[A quiet moment.]] */ %>

:: I came here with a friend...
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> scratches <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> head. "I probably haven't seen 'em. What's this friend of yours look like?"

* [[He's a guinea pig, about this tall...|Describe Reese.]]

:: Have you seen my friend?
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> takes a thoughtful sip from a plastic cup.

"Depends who's asking," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> replies.

* [[Tell <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> your name.|Tell her your name.]]

:: Tell her your name.
You say your name is Hollis.

"Pleased to meet you, Hollis, I'm <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>." From <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> tone, you suspect <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s being at least a little sarcastic. "Now, this friend of yours?"

* [[<%-R.Reese?"He":"She"%>'s a guinea pig, about this tall...|Describe Reese.]]

:: Describe Reese.
You give <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> a brief description of your friend, Reese.

"Sorry, haven't seen <%-R.Reese?"him":"her"%>," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> shrugs and says, "But at a party like this, I wouldn't be surprised if <%-R.Reese?"he":"she"%> was already in some pred's gut."

* [[What!?|What do you mean?]]

:: What do you mean?
<% StoryFlags.set("upstairsUnlocked"); %>

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> gives you a slightly patronizing stare.

"C'mon, you'd have to be an idiot not to realize. This whole place is practically crawling with preds. Your bud probably got dragged into a broom closet somewhere and gurgled. That's all there is to it."

* [[But, um, if he wasn't...?]]
* [[That's kind of hot...]]

:: But, um, if he wasn't...?
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> shrugs.

"I mean, you could probably check in the rooms upstairs. Somewhere secluded and private, that's probably where I'd go... *if* I was trying to eat someone..."

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> clears <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> throat. "Not that that's like, a thing that I've ever done, or anything."

* [[Y-you could eat me, if you wanted to...|Ana, I want you to eat me.]]
* [[Thank you, goodbye.]]

:: Thank you, goodbye.
You excuse yourself politely, and head back into the house. <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> gives a casual wave as you leave.

* [[Go back to the foyer.|The Foyer.]]

:: Ana, I want you to eat me.
You brain tells to you to stop. That you're making a big mistake. After hesitating for a second, you finally open your mouth, and manage to get the words out.

The hyena looks at you with astonishment. "R-really?" <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> confusion turns into something of a bemused smile.

"You *want* me to eat you? Like, 'eat you' eat you? Digestion and all?"
* [[...Yes please.]]
* [[No, wait.]]

:: That's kind of hot...
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> blushes, but looks at you interestedly.

"You... think vore is *hot*? I guess that's not a surprise, considering you're *here*. You just didn't strike me as that kind of rabbit."

* [[N-no! I meant...]]

:: N-no! I meant...
Thinking quickly you tell <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>, uh, you meant, that you think predators are hot! Not that you're assuming <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s a— no, fuck, um...

"Deep breaths, pal."

You clear your throat. What you meant to say was that digesting inside is a stomach, is literally a hot place to be. Like, temperature-wise. Not that you'd ever *want* to be digested in a stomach. Or-or- even thought about anything like that!

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> pauses thoughtfully for a moment. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> sharp, shiny teeth glint in the moonlight. "...Hollis, do you want me to digest you?"

* [[...Yes please.]]
* [[No, wait.]]

:: No, wait.
You tell <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> might've gotten the wrong idea. You're not interested in being digested.

"Oh," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, clearly a little disappointed. "Sorry, but I don't spit my prey up." <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> gestures to <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> slightly chubby belly, and says, "There's only one way outta here, and it's not pretty. I take it you're not interested anymore?"

* [[No, thank you though.]]
* [[You can digest me, if you want...]]

:: No, thank you though.
"Oh, no problem," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> says, clearly a little crestfallen.

You awkwardly excuse yourself, and walk back into the foyer. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> waves half-heartedly as you leave.

* <a0 data-passage="The Foyer.">Go back to the foyer.</a>

:: ...Yes please.
You can't believe you're saying this.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> chuckles, "Gee, I'm that obvious as a predator, huh?" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> stands up and gives you a big smile. "Y'know, talking to you was making me *really* hungry." You blush, and <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> gives you a paw and helps you up. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> tail is wagging eagerly. "You're sure about this?"

You nod.

"Okay!" <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "follow me!"

* [[Follow <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> into the yard.|Follow Ana into the yard.]]

:: You can digest me, if you want...
You blushingly tell <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> you've had a change of heart. You're ready to get gurgled.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> stands up and gives you a big smile. "You sure? Awesome! Y'know, talking to you was making me *really* hungry." You blush, and <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> gives you a paw and helps you up. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> tail is wagging eagerly.

"Okay!" <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "follow me!"

* [[Follow <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> into the yard.|Follow Ana into the yard.]]

:: Follow Ana into the yard.
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> leads you by the paw further into a darker part of the backyard, out of view. "Nobody should bother us out here," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says. You shiver with excitement.

"Now, just one condition for me to eat you. Once I eat you, you're mine. If you change your mind, you can kick and squirm all you like, but you're not coming out. No backsies. Got it?"

"No teeth, I promise." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> gives you a cute smile. "My belly definitely won't go easy on you, but you'll probably pass out before you start digesting anyway. I definitely won't bite or scratch you."

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> murmurs, "Not hard, anyway..."

* [[Should I feel reassured?]]

:: Should I feel reassured?
"Well, people say I can be pretty feisty. At least, when they're not saying things like, 'Aah stop!!' and, '<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> you said you weren't gonna digest me!'"

You give <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> a horrified expression.

"Kidding!" <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "Honestly, I don't bite."

* [[Okay...|Any questions?]]

:: How does it feel to have live prey inside you?
As you ask <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> this, <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s belly grumbles expectantly. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pats it, and looks thoughtful for a second.

"It's uh, kinda hard to describe, beyond saying it feels *super* good. Like, imagine getting a shiatsu massage from the *inside*. Except, the masseuse is made out of *bacon*... or like, carrots, or whatever rabbits eat. I'm not explaining it right."

"Like, from the ground? Weird."

<%= story.render("Any questions?") %>

"Nah," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "I can digest clothes no problem. You're lucky you're dealing with an experienced predator!"

"I mean, you could get naked if you *wanted* to, but, it's not like you're gonna impress me with your dick." <% if (!R.Ana) { %><%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> winks. "I guarantee mine's bigger."<% } %>

You remove your clothes, in the hopes that it'll make you easier on <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s stomach.

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> looks at the fur of your naked body with intrigue, <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> eyes drifting towards your crotch. "O-oh! That's uh, very considerate of you."

<%= story.render("Any questions?") %>

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> sticks <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> nose into your neck, smelling you over with a slightly invasive tenacity.

"Yeah, rabbit fur is usually really soft and delicious. Oh, and those ears!" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> playfully licks one, which sends a shiver down your spine. "Yeah, you taste great."

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> puts a paw on <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> chin. "...Although maybe you could dump a bottle of salad dressing on yourself... Oh! Or do a quick beer baste!"

* [[I'm good, I think.]]

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pats <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> gut, and says, "So, you're *completely* sure you don't wanna be my shit? Even if I'm *extra* gentle when I eat you?"
* [[No, thank you though.]]
* [[...I'm ready to be eaten.|Okay, I'm ready.]]

:: Okay, I'm ready.
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> grins. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%>'s practically drooling just from looking at you.

"Thanks for doing this. I promise to be extra careful as I digest you into my shit."

* [[You're welcome!|Get vored by Ana.]]

:: Get vored by Ana. [vore]
<% s.previousCommand = "You're w-"; %>
You're about to say <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s welcome, when <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> suddenly lunges at you and clamps <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> slobbering maw down over your head. Your world suddenly becomes dark, wet, and smelling faintly like mint toothpaste. True to <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> word, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s feisty, but not actually using teeth.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> deftly wraps <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> paws around your torso, and with a firm thrust, pushes your head, neck, and shoulders into <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> slimy esophagus, swallowing them almost instantly. You consider that as a hyena, maybe <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s predisposed to consuming as much food as possible before someone else gets to it. Or maybe <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s just experienced. Either way, the speed and ravenousness with which <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> traps you in <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> stomach is almost incredible.

Before you know it, <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> is eagerly gulping down your feet, leaving you curled up into a tight, wet ball inside <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> squeezing stomach walls.

"BUUUURP," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> concludes, licking <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> lips. "How was that?"

* [[...F-fast?]]

:: ...F-fast? [vore]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> snickers, patting the huge furry bulge you've made in <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> gut. "What, did you want me to <%= (visited("...I don't have a dick.")) ? "jill" : "jack" %> you off on the way down?"

<%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> mention of the possibility arouses you a little. However, cramped as you are, you're fairly certain you can't quite reach your privates anymore. Curled up in the pit of the hyena's belly, you're surrounded by liquids which coat your fur, and sting your skin a little bit.

"So, my little morsel, do you like it in there?"

* [[It's... very tight.]]

:: It's... very tight. [vore]
"Hfff," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> sighs, "well *I'm* enjoying you in there.&nbsp;You really were a yummy snack, Hollis."

Absentmindedly, <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> sticks a paw down <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> jeans, and begins stroking <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%>. You can feel the impact of each stroke bumping against <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> engorged belly.

You ask <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> if <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s jerking off.

"...Yeah. I dunno why but having you in there is making me, like, *rock* hard.
<% if (s.uhYeahMeNeither) { %>Or, at least, that's what I *would* say, if I did have a penis, which, as established earlier, I don't.
<% } %>" As <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> masturbates, the jostling of <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> gut causes a bit of stomach acid to splash into your mouth.

It's not pleasant.

* [[I didn't realize how hot it would be...]]

:: I didn't realize how hot it would be... [vore]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> asks, "Hot as in sexy, or hot like temperature-wise?"

You tell <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%> temperature-wise.

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> scoffs, "Well *I* didn't realize I had eaten a sensitive pansy!" <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> places a hand over <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> belly to stabilize it while <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> continues masturbating. "Don't tell me you're already having second thoughts about this whole digestion thing."
* [[...Maybe?]]
* [[N-no! I'm loving it!]]

:: ...Maybe? [vore]
"Mmmm, that's a shame," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> says, "because you're way too delicious to let go. A deal's a deal, bucko. You're hyena fat now."

You cough and choke on a little more stomach fluids. They're getting deeper, and it's gradually becoming harder to breathe.

* [[...Please let me out?]]
* [[Digest willingly.]]

:: N-no! I'm loving it! [vore checkpoint]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> lightly jiggles <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> belly again, this time letting out a husky moan.

"Good," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, "because you feel *fantastic* in there."

You open your mouth to speak, but you accidentally swallow some of <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> stomach juices.

* [[...Please let me out?]]
* [[Digest willingly.]]

:: ...Please let me out? [vore]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> lets out an exasperated groan, but <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> masturbation doesn't stop.

"Oh my fuck. I literally had *one* rule!" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> gives your body a firm pat, which makes you shudder. "Not sure how to put this politely Hollis, but you're just food now. You're my food, and I'm digesting you, end of discussion. Any further comments, your *majesty*?"

You can only let out a small whimper.

"Good," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> says, and continues pleasuring <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>self.

* [[(oh god oh fuck.)|Move around inside Ana.]]

:: Move around inside Ana. [vore]
Your pulse quickens as you feel <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s stomach acids gradually filling up beneath you.  This isn't anything like you imagined it would be. You try to reposition to keep your paws out of the liquid, but slip and accidentally kick into <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> thick stomach walls.

"Woah," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> says, letting out a surprised little moan, "Urp, I love strugglers...!"

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, please let me out!|Ana, please let me out!]]

:: Ana, please let me out! [vore]
You scramble against the walls of <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s belly, choking on enzymes and stomach fluid. Whatever limited air is left around you is being used up pretty fast. In response, <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> simply lets out a fierce, excited grunt as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> pleasures <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%>. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%>'s clearly approaching orgasm.

You're now feeling woozy and light-headed, and massively regret offering yourself as a meal. In desperation, you yell out to get the hyena's attention, but <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> merely growls back, "Jeez, do you ever stop whining?"

"Look," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> grunts, "I'll let you out after I orgasm, okay? Just gimme a second. I'm so... freakin'... close...!!!"

* [[I can't breathe...]]

:: I can't breathe... [vore]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> strokes <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%> faster and faster. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> eagerness even seems to increase as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> realizes you're already being affected by <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> digestive juices.

"Hnng, mmm, yeah... Right... There..."

Frantically, you begin to struggle with the last remaining bit of strength you have left. You kick and stretch and thrash against the thick stomach walls which imprison you. You struggle desperately, until you can no longer. Exhaustion and the lack of oxygen are rapidly creeping up on you.

"Nf... Oh *fuck*, Hollis, you're squirming sooo... good..." <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s voice escalates in pitch.  "I'm gonna... fucking..."

You shut your eyes, as you begin to dissolve into oblivion. You decide to take... just a teeny tiny nap... until...

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Cum.|Ana: Cum.]]

:: Digest willingly. [vore]
You remain silent, and take a few deep breaths to relax yourself. Maybe this isn't really so bad. It's certainly warm in here, and the sound of <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s racing heart reminds you of some ASMR videos you watched one time.

Besides, you did agree that you wouldn't change your mind. It's your fetish, after all.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> lets out a relieved sigh, and keeps going. "Say, um, do you think you could struggle a little for me?"

You don't see why not.

* [[Squirm.|Squirm for Ana's pleasure.]]

:: Squirm for Ana's pleasure. [vore]
You wriggle your body around, hoping to maybe reposition yourself into a more comfortable position.

"Woah," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> says, letting out a surprised little moan, "I love strugglers...! Mmmmph!"

The already tight confines of <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s stomach get even tighter as <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s stomach secretes more stingy liquids. It's not painful, but it's making your fur feel a little tingly.

You tell <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, um, you think <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'s starting to digest you.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> stifles a moan. "Do you need me to let you out?"

* [[N-no, I'm okay.|N-no, I'm okay. (Ana)]]

:: N-no, I'm okay. (Ana) [vore]
"Good," <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> says, "Keep struggling, prey."

You begin to kick and squirm against the slick walls of flesh around you. You make an effort to avoid touching the pool of digestive enzymes when possible, but as they continue to flood the chamber, this becomes increasingly difficult.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> lets out a fierce, excited grunt in response. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> eager stroking seems to get faster as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> realizes you're already being affected by <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> digestive juices.

You shut your eyes, and resign to fulfill your role as food. It truly is a wonderful feeling. You feel yourself beginning to drift off.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> growls out, "Oh... yess... I'm gonna... fucking..."

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Cum.|Ana: Cum.]]

:: Ana: Cum.
"Mmmmh!" <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> lets out a long, satisfied grunt, and yanks <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> pants down, just as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> begins to <%-R.Ana?"gush with":"shoot off"%> off spurt after spurt of <%-R.Ana?"squirt":"jizz"%> onto <% if (visited("Undress in front of Ana outside.")) { %>your discarded clothes<% } else { %>the grass<% } %>. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> moans out, "Mmmm, yeahhh..." and collapses back on the garden bench, hoisting <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> swollen belly.

<% if (visited("Digest willingly.") || visited("N-no, I'm okay. (Ana)")) { %>

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> reclines in satisfaction. as <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> body begins to slowly reclaim nutrients from <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> latest meal.

The hyena sighs contentedly. "Hahhhh, that was hot... Was it good for you too? ...Hollis?" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pokes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> gut a few times, but no response comes except for a belch of putrid air.

"Gone already? Jeez, that must be a new record..."

<% } else { %>

The hyena sighs contentedly. "Hahhhh, that was hot... Okay, I've had my fun. I can let you out now if you want... Hollis?" <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> pokes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> gut a few times, but no response comes except for a belch of putrid air. "Oh. Looks like you won't be coming out after all... Whoops..."

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> reclines as <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> body begins to slowly reclaim nutrients from <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> latest meal. "Well Hollis, sorry for digesting you. If it's any consolation, that was probably the hardest I've ever <%-R.Ana?"cummed":"jizzed"%>... So um, no hard feelings?"

<%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> prey only responds with a burble, and another loud burp.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> giggles contendedly. "...I'll take that as a yes."

<%=T.CWP("Desperate to poop", "Graphic scat", "Urination", "Chain restaurants")%>

The morning sun beats down. A hung-over hyena wakes up on a bench in the backyard of the Armstrong household.

"Ughhhh," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> groans, clutching <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> forehead and trying to recall what exactly <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> did last night. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> clutches <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> swollen, burbling middle. It's smaller than it was, but still bulging out slightly under <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> shirt.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> feels guilty, somewhat, as <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> remembers the rabbit who filled it. Their name was Holland... Or, Hollister... Something like that.

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%>'s soon distracted by the more pressing matter of that rabbit's remains snaking their way through <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> intestines.

"Ah, shit," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> mutters.

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Go inside to poop?|Ana: Go inside to poop?]]

:: Ana: Go inside to poop? [morning]
At your command, <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> looks towards the house, but quickly rules that out as an option. It'd be extremely awkward to invite <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%> inside just to take a dump. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> has a feeling that any toilet <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> uses will probably be out of service afterward.

<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> wracks <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> brain, trying to think of the best place to squeeze <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> ex-prey out.

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Shit in the backyard.|Ana: Shit in the backyard.]]
* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Drive somewhere with public restrooms.|Ana: Drive somewhere with public restrooms.]]

:: Ana: Shit in the backyard. [morning]
Not an option. While the trees out here provided some good cover last night, in broad daylight <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> would still be fairly visible. Not to mention, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%>'d be leaving behind a massive turd in the backyard of a complete stranger.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> clutches <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> head. <em.ana>Yeah,</em> <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> thinks, <em.ana>not the best idea...</em>

* [[Drive somewhere with a public restrooms.|Ana: Drive somewhere with public restrooms.]]

:: Ana: Drive somewhere with public restrooms. [morning]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> growls. <em.ana>Wow, that's really my only option? Fine.</em>

The hyena scampers discretely through the yard, around the massive house, and onto the sidewalk. Every step makes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> swollen gut squish uncomfortably. <%-R.Ana?"His":"Her"%> meal wants out, *now*. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> walks to <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> car with the determined yet careful stride of someone who desperately needs a toilet.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s car is a dinged up, ancient vehicle. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> inherited it from <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> mother, a hyena almost as unkempt and mangy as the car. <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s mom was a ruthless predator, and the primary reason <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> didn't have a father growing up. In fact, it was precisely twenty-one years ago today when he was-

<em.ana>Hey,</em> <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> thinks, <em.ana>quit narrating my tragic backstory, I need to take a shit, NOW.</em>

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Fine, whatever, just drive.|Ana: Fine, whatever, just drive.]]

:: Ana: Fine, whatever, just drive. [morning]
<%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> starts the car and drives for a few minutes, breathing slowly and scanning for the nearest possible location. That happens to be Pizza Shack, the world-famous purveyor of greasy low-price 'zza.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> parks and power-walks inside, <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> nose suddenly accosted by the thick stench of pepperoni. Upon entering, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> is immediately accosted by a friendly dog wearing the uniform of a Pizza Shack employee.

<div.multicommand>

* [["Hi! Welcome to Pizza Shack!"|Employee: Hi!]]
* [["I'm Chet, I'll be your server today."|Employee: Hi!]]
* [["Have you dined with us before?"|Employee: Hi!]]

</div>

:: Employee: Hi! [morning]
<% s.previousCommand = "Hi! Welcome to-"; %>
"Fucking *move*!" <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> shoves past the employee and makes a bee-line for the restroom doors.

Like most public bathrooms, they're segregated by size, offering one stall labeled *gentlekind* (a traditional term for anthros taller than 7 feet), one marked *noblekind*, for anthros of medium height, and one marked *littlekind*, for those smaller than 4 feet. Some mixed-use establishments like airports will also have special *Tinykind* toilets, which are barely three inches tall, but it's rare to see one out in the suburbs.

<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>, desperately holding a load of ex-rabbit inside <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> bowels, and not needing such common knowledge narrated to <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>, knocks on the middle door.

"Sorry, occupied," comes the reply.

Groaning, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> checks the gentlekind door, but it's out of service for cleaning.

<em.ana>Fucking dammit,</em> <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> thinks, eyeing the slightly diminished door leading into the smallest of the three restrooms.

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Poop in the tiny toilet.|Ana: Poop in the tiny toilet.]]
* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Wait until they're finished.|Ana: Wait until they're finished.]]

:: Ana: Wait until they're finished. [morning]
<em.ana>Haha, fuck that.</em>

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Shit Hollis out in the tiny toilet.|Ana: Poop in the tiny toilet.]]

:: Ana: Poop in the tiny toilet. [morning]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> crouches to enter the littlekind restroom, and naturally finds a toilet designed for anthros much smaller than <%-R.Ana?"himself":"herself"%>. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> yanks down <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> pants, hovers <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> large ass over the small toilet bowl, and...

* [[<em.ana>Haaaaaaaahh.</em>|Ana: Squeeze out Hollis.]]

:: Ana: Squeeze out Hollis. [morning]
...Immediately begins squeezing out a thick, solid turd.

The shit is smooth, but speckled with gray fur and partially-dissolved bones. The telltale signs of a fast metabolism, and a low-fiber diet. The sensation of squeezing it out is almost euphoric. Partially due to how bad <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> needed to do it, and partially a result of <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> natural inclinations as a predator.

The hyena grunts as a shit-packed, partially cracked rabbit skull begins to stretch <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> asshole impossibly wide.

* [[<em.ana>Hhhrrrrrrnnnng!</em>|Ana: Poop out skull.]]

:: Ana: Poop out skull. [morning]
After straining for several seconds, the skull finally passes through with a loud "plop". <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> breathes a sigh of relief.

As <%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>'s asshole squeezes them out, Hollis's remains pile up in the small toilet bowl, well past the point at which they'd be reasonable to flush. The hyena is panting softly, almost overjoyed to get <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> prey out of <%-R.Ana?"him":"her"%>.

As <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> pinches off the last turd, <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> asshole finally relaxes, and <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> lets loose a heavy stream of piss, splashing wildly atop the disgusting mound of what was formerly a living, breathing person.

* [[<em.ana>Phew...</em>|Ana: Done pooping.]]

:: Ana: Done pooping. [morning]
<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%> wipes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> ass, which is now slightly fatter than it was last night. <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> stands up, and takes a moment to admire <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> brown handiwork.

"Wow, way bigger than I thought it'd be," <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> remarks, "Well, goodbye, uh, whatever your name was!"

* [[<%-R.Ana?"Andrew":"Ana"%>: Flush...?|Ana: Flush...?]]

:: Ana: Flush...? [morning]
Anticipating the worst, <%-R.Ana?"he":"she"%> pushes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> claw down the handle to flush. The small toilet sputters, but makes no effort to swallow the massive turd. It remains perfectly still in the bowl.

"Shit," the hyena sighs, "Well, looks like you're Chet's problem now." <%-R.Ana?"He":"She"%> washes <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> paws, turns toward the door, and walks out with <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> tail held high, and a satisfied smile on <%-R.Ana?"his":"her"%> face.

"I could really fuck up some pizza..."
