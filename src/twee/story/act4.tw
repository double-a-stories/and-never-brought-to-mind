:: Chapter 2

4:00 PM: DASHEL
- Species: Stoat
- Gender: Cis
A fast-talking hot-shot professional, classist, speciesist asshole. He crashes into you and spills his drink on himself like an idiot. "This is an expensive suit, carrot-breath!" Initially mistakes you for a waiter... and then an appetizer.

THREAT: Dashel wants to kick your ass for talking back to him.
Defuse.
Talk shit.
